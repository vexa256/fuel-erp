üì± APPLE THEMING & UI/UX COMPLIANCE GUIDELINES (MANDATORY)
1. COLOR & THEME
Follow Apple‚Äôs Light and Dark Mode paradigms: Ensure all color choices, backgrounds, and overlays adapt perfectly for both light and dark themes. Never hardcode backgrounds; always use Metronic 8 utilities that can be remapped for dark/light.

Use Apple‚Äôs vibrancy and depth: Layer backgrounds with translucency using Metronic 8 classes (e.g., bg-light-* and overlay effects). Foreground elements must always stand out, with adequate shadow (shadow-sm, shadow-lg).

Contrast: All text and icons must have WCAG AA/AAA-level contrast. Never allow faded or low-contrast UI.

2. TYPOGRAPHY
Follow iOS text hierarchy:

Page Titles: fs-1 fw-bold text-gray-900

Section Headers: fs-3 fw-bold text-gray-800

Content: fs-5 text-gray-700

Captions/hints: fs-7 text-gray-500

Line height and spacing: Text must always be readable, never cramped. Use Metronic‚Äôs spacing utilities to ensure breathing room.

NO text overflow or cut-off at any breakpoint. All copy should resize naturally, wrapping as needed.

3. COMPONENTS & INTERACTIONS
Touch Targets: Minimum size 44px √ó 44px (Apple‚Äôs standard). All buttons, form fields, and icons must meet or exceed this, using btn-lg, form-control-lg, and padding utilities.

Feedback: Every touch interaction must provide visible feedback‚Äîuse Metronic‚Äôs active, focus, and hover states. Button tap = visual state change.

Gestures: Swipe actions (where applicable) must animate smoothly, never stutter.

No non-standard popups or modals: Use iOS modal/card patterns only (Metronic 8 cards, drawers, or overlays).

4. LAYOUT & NAVIGATION
Single, stacked column flow (mobile-first). No sidebars.

Sticky headers: Always visible, never scroll away key navigation or actions.

Safe Area: Respect iOS safe area insets‚Äînever put controls under the notch, status bar, or home bar.

Navigation: Use large, tappable nav bars, clear back buttons with duotone icons (ki-duotone).

Tab bars: If used, they must be fixed to the bottom, high contrast, with clear active state.

5. CARDS & CONTAINERS
Apple Card Style: All cards must be rounded (rounded-2xl), shadowed (shadow), and separated by breathing space (mb-4, gap-4).

Hierarchy: Important actions and summaries go in prominent cards at the top, less critical info below.

Edge-to-edge: Content can go edge-to-edge, but padding (p-4, px-6) must be applied to every block for comfort.

6. FORMS & INPUTS
Label Above Input: Always use label-on-top, never inline or floating label.

Huge inputs: form-control-lg, full width (w-100), generous vertical padding (py-3).

Clear CTA separation: All actions should have enough space to avoid accidental taps.

7. ICONOGRAPHY
Use only KT Duotone icons with nested <span class="path1"></span> <span class="path2"></span> structure for Apple-like depth.

Icon size: No smaller than 24px, ideally 28‚Äì32px for most touch targets.

Color: Use vivid Metronic colors‚Äîtext-primary, text-warning, etc.‚Äînever generic gray.

8. ANIMATION & MOTION
Motion must be subtle and purposeful: Use smooth transitions for card opening, list insertions, button taps (Metronic transition utilities or Apple‚Äôs spring-style easing).

Reduce motion for accessibility: UI must remain fully usable with ‚Äúreduce motion‚Äù settings.

9. DATA & TABLES (FAVOUR CARDS FOR DATA RENDERING OVER TABLES AND AVOID THEM WHENEVER possible)
Responsive, Apple-style tables: Use table align-middle table-row-dashed, bold headings, and never crowd the content.

Status Badges: Use Metronic badges (badge-light-success, badge-light-warning) for all dynamic states.

10. ACCESSIBILITY
Full VoiceOver compliance: All controls must have aria-label and role attributes set.

Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements must be reachable and usable via keyboard.

Colorblind-friendly: Never rely on color alone for critical meaning‚Äîalways use icons/badges/text together.

üö® STRICT ENFORCEMENT
Any violation of these Apple and Metronic 8 rules is categorically rejected.

All output must pass Apple HIG and Metronic 8 QA‚Äîno exceptions.

If there is any ambiguity, default to Apple‚Äôs HIG and err on the side of clarity, accessibility, and tactile comfort.

COMMAND:

‚ÄúOBEY every Apple iOS HIG and Metronic 8 class rule above. Build the UI as if it is to be demoed for an Apple executive and Metronic 8 design lead side-by-side‚Äîfailure is not an option.‚Äù 

üß† INTENT AND OUTPUT MANDATE:
Your result must be directly pluggable into any index.html-based Vue 3 app using Metronic 8‚Äîzero rewrite required.

It must pass production review at Apple and Metronic simultaneously on first glance.

The entire interface must scream ‚ÄúiOS Native‚Äù with supercharged Metronic flair‚Äîno compromise.

Always cross-check with the attached absolute project instructions for this and every interaction.

Any violation is unacceptable‚Äîthis is the gold standard for enterprise iOS UI.




COMMAND:

‚ÄúGENERATE a 100% iOS-native, ultra-modern, AI-powered UI layout using only Vue 3 and Metronic 8 classes, following Apple‚Äôs Human Interface Guidelines in all layout, spacing, color, and interaction, with no exceptions, no images, and absolutely no non-Metronic dependencies. Layout and all touch controls must be iOS-level elite. OBEY ALL ATTACHED PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS FULLY‚ÄîWITHOUT FAIL.‚Äù
