Audit Logs & Fraud-rule Engine

This augmented list now fully aligns with the critical capabilities repeatedly cited in international guidance and leading vendor playbooks, ensuring you won’t hit regulatory or operational blind spots when you launch.

Below is a production-ready approval framework trimmed to the absolute minimum you must ship in v1, yet architected so you can layer more complexity later without refactoring tables or code.

1. Core Concepts
Concept	Why it exists	MVP rule
Approval Item	The business object awaiting sign-off (PO, stock-adjustment, etc.)	Always linked by item_type + item_id
Approval Rule	Declares who must approve what and when	One SQL-driven rule set (see §3)
Approval Flow	Ordered list of approval steps generated from the rule	Exactly two levels in MVP
Approval Action	A human decision on a step (approve, reject, skip)	Recorded with signature + timestamp
Escalation	Auto-moves a step to the next approver after an SLA breach	Fixed 24 h in MVP

2. Features that must be approval-gated on Day 1
#	Triggering event	Initiator → Approver L1	Optional L2 (auto-adds when amount ≥ threshold)
1	Fuel/merchandise Purchase Order creation	Station Manager → Area/Ops Manager	CFO if PO ≥ USD 10 000
2	Supplier Delivery ≠ PO qty (variance ≠ 0)	Receiver → Station Manager	Area/Ops Manager if variance > ±2 %
3	Manual Stock Adjustment (gain/loss)	Station Manager → Area/Ops Manager	Finance Controller if adjustment ≥ 500 L or value ≥ USD 2 000
4	Inter-station Transfer (send)	Sending Station Manager → Receiving Station Manager	—
5	Fuel Price-Book Change	Pricing Analyst → CFO	—
6	Shift Close Variance (cash or fuel) beyond tolerance	Cashier → Station Manager	—
7	Ledger Journal Correction	Accountant → Finance Controller	—

These seven cover every “money-moving” or “loss-exposure” scenario flagged by global forecourt ERP references. Anything else can go post-MVP.

3. Minimal Data Model (relational)
text

Edit
Approvals
---------
id (PK)
item_type            -- e.g. 'purchase_order'
item_id              -- FK to the business table
current_step_no      -- tinyint
status ENUM('pending','approved','rejected','cancelled')
sla_hours            -- default 24
created_by (FK users)
created_at, updated_at

ApprovalSteps
-------------
id (PK)
approval_id  (FK Approvals)
step_no      -- 1-based order
role_code    -- e.g. 'OPS_MGR'
threshold    -- numeric; NULL = always
status ENUM('pending','approved','rejected','skipped')
due_at       -- calculated (created_at + sla_hours)
acted_by (FK users, NULL)
acted_at DATETIME NULL
notes TEXT NULL

ApprovalActions
---------------
id (PK)
approval_step_id (FK ApprovalSteps)
action ENUM('approve','reject','skip','auto_escalate')
actor_id (FK users or system user)
comment TEXT NULL
created_at
Indexes: (item_type,item_id), (status), (due_at)

4. Rule Engine (single SQL view, no code)
Create a view approval_rules_vw that lists each item_type + step_no + role_code + threshold.
On insertion of a new PO/Adjustment/etc. you insert into Approvals, then bulk-insert its step rows by selecting from this view where item_type matches and (threshold IS NULL OR amount >= threshold).

This keeps rules data-driven and editable via admin screen—zero hard-coded workflow.

5. State Machine

draft (business record) ──submit──▶ PENDING[step 1]
        ▲                               │
        └─────────reject───────────────┘

PENDING[step n] ──approve──▶ PENDING[step n+1]
        │
        ├──reject──▶ REJECTED (broadcast event)
        │
        └──timeout (24h)──▶ auto_escalate(action logged) → PENDING[next role]

PENDING[last] ──approve──▶ APPROVED (unfreeze record, post-effects fire)
Effects when APPROVED

PO: status → approved; receive workflow may begin.

Stock Adj.: inventory updated.

Price change: new price pushed to stations.

Ledger correction: GL entries posted.

Effects when REJECTED

Business record flagged rejected, edit-in-place allowed; must resubmit to restart approval.

6. Integration Hooks
Module	When to raise approval	Blocking?
PO service	After PO header saved	Yes – cannot dispatch to supplier
Inventory service	On adjust_stock() API	Yes – qty held in suspense table
Transfer service	On create_transfer()	Yes for send; receive side auto-unblocks when approved
Pricing service	On update_price()	No – schedule change; job won’t publish until approval
Cash-up	When variance > tolerance	No – shift closes but flagged “pending sign-off”

7. Notifications & Escalations (MVP)
Email + in-app bell at step creation.

Cron job every 30 min: UPDATE ApprovalSteps SET status='auto_escalate' … where due_at < NOW() AND status='pending'; insert action row, advance current_step_no.

Dashboard widget: “My Approvals (count)”.

8. Roles & Default Mappings
Role code	Default user group
STN_MGR	Station Manager
OPS_MGR	Area/Operations Manager
CFO	Chief Finance Officer
FIN_CTRL	Finance Controller
PRC_AN	Pricing Analyst
ACCT	Accountant

(Stored in roles and linked via user_roles.)

9. What not to build for MVP
No multi-parallel or conditional branches—single linear flow only.

No delegation delegation (vacation rules).

No partial-approval overrides; it’s binary approve/reject.

No granular field-level audit inside items—covered by existing AuditLogs.

Ship Checklist
Tables + Seed roles & view.

ApprovalService::submit($itemType,$itemId,$amount,$userId) inserting flow.

Middleware MustBeApproved guarding every blocked business endpoint.

Cron worker EscalateOverdueStepsJob.

Blade partial Approvals/Inbox with approve/reject buttons.

Implement these pieces and every high-risk transaction listed in §2 will be held, routed, and unblocked only after the right person signs off—nothing more, nothing less, perfect for v1 launch.
